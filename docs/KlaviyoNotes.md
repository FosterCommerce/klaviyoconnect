# Klaviyo Notes

[Klaviyo HTTP API](https://www.klaviyo.com/docs/http-api)

## Add cart items to a Klaviyo email content section

From the Klaviyo email content editor, click "View source" in text editor toolbar.

Enter your code. Here's an example:

```twig
<ul>
{% for Item in event.Line_Items %}
	<li><a href="https://www.example.com{{ Item.URL }}">{{ Item.Title }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
```

Save and test the email to make sure it looks good.

## Klaviyo Special Properties

The Klaviyo API includes the following special properties via HTTP. These properties are implemented in Klaviyo Connect without the `$`. For instance, a typical `Profile` model would look like this:

```php
new Profile([
  'email' => 'hi@mysite.com',
  'first_name' => 'Jane',
  'last_name' => 'Doe',
  // ...
])
```

### User Profile Properties

- `id` - your unique identifier for a person
- `email` - email address
- `first_name` - first name
- `last_name` - last name
- `phone_number` - phone number
- `title` - title at their business or organization
- `organization` - business or organization they belong to
- `city` - city they live in
- `region` - region or state they live in
- `country` - country they live in
- `zip` - postal code where they live
- `image` - url to a photo of the person
- `consent` - This identifies which types of consent a subscriber has given. Consent is stored as a list array and may contain several properties, like Email and Web. There are five supported values for consent, which correspond to different methods you can use for marketing to your subscribers: `"email"`, `"web"`, `"mobile"`, `"sms"`, `"directmail"`
- `consent_method` - This identifies the method that a subscriber used to opt in
- `consent_timestamp` - This is a timestamp recording precisely when the user submitted the form and granted consent. This is added automatically by Klaviyo if it is not present in the Profile data

### Event Properties

- `unique_id` - An unique identifier for an event
- `value` - A numeric value to associate with this event (e.g. the dollar value of a purchase)
- `value_currency` - The ISO 4217 currency code of the value associated with the event.
