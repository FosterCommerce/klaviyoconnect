## Public and Private API Keys

First, include your Klaviyo Public and Private API keys and click save to connect to Klaviyo.

You can access these keys by logging into Klaviyo, and clicking your account icon (in the upper right) and selecting Account, then clicking the Settings menu and then selecting "API Keys". Or click here: [https://www.klaviyo.com/account#api-keys-tab](https://www.klaviyo.com/account#api-keys-tab)

*Save these settings in the Klaviyo Connect configuration section before setting the other configuration options.*
